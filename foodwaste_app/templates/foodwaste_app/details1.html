                <h2>Reducing Food Waste at Home: Tips and Strategies</h2>
                    <p>Almost half of the total global food waste is household food waste, and there is a growing research effort to resolve the 
                        increasing issue of food waste to address this big environmental challenge, Heidenstr√∏m, N., et. Al., 2021. 
                    <p>Below are some tips and strategies to reduce food waste at home.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <br><b>Read the labels' food storage requirement if there is any.</b> Understanding the food storage requirement plays a big part in how to preserve 
                            food. Aside from the nutritional diet, the food label displays the temperature requirement and proper storage to maximize its best-before date.
                    <p></p>
                    <br><b>Organize food according to size and have everything visible.</b> It applies to storage cabinets and fridges. If the taller items 
                            cover the smaller foods, they are missed and spoil or expire.
                    <p></p>
                    <br><b>Reduce fridge temperature to 4 degrees Celsius.</b> According to Brown, T., et. Al, pg. 8, (2014), "reducing temperatures, for example, to 4 degrees Celsius 
                            could significantly extend storage lives, giving greater opportunity for use before disposal". Although results vary depending on food storage and appliance type, 
                            their experiment has suggested that reducing the fridge temperature by approximately at least 4 degrees Celsius will significantly extend the life of the food 
                            inside the fridge.
